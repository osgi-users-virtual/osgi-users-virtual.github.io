# Content

If there are nor **subfolders** or **files** properties given for a *nested* layout, the page is considered to ba a pure content page. 
Content can also be displayed within a nested page with the above mentioned properties set, but there will be cards above the content, linking to the specified **subfolders** and **files**.
All examples below are made with a front matter like this:

```
---
layout: nested
title: Lorem Ipsum
description: Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet

```

The content below is taken from Adam Pritchard's [Markdown Cheatsheet](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet).

## Text

```
This is normal text.

## Headers

Headers of the level H1/H2 can be seen in the text

```
### H3
#### H4
##### H5
###### H6
```

### H3
#### H4
##### H5

## Lists

```
1. First ordered list item
2. Another item
  * Unordered sub-list. 
1. Actual numbers don't matter, just that it's a number
  1. Ordered sub-list
4. And another item.

   You can have properly indented paragraphs within list items. Notice the blank line above, and the leading spaces (at least one, but we'll use three here to also align the raw Markdown).

   To have a line break without a paragraph, you will need to use two trailing spaces.⋅⋅
   Note that this line is separate, but within the same paragraph.⋅⋅
   (This is contrary to the typical GFM line break behaviour, where trailing spaces are not required.)

* Unordered list can use asterisks
- Or minuses
+ Or pluses
```

## Links

```
[I'm an inline-style link](https://www.google.com)

[I'm an inline-style link with title](https://www.google.com "Google's Homepage")

[I'm a reference-style link][Arbitrary case-insensitive reference text]

[You can use numbers for reference-style link definitions][1]

Or leave it empty and use the [link text itself].

URLs and URLs in angle brackets will automatically get turned into links. 
http://www.example.com or <http://www.example.com> and sometimes 
example.com (but not on Github, for example).

Some text to show that the reference links can follow later.

[arbitrary case-insensitive reference text]: https://www.mozilla.org
[1]: http://slashdot.org
[link text itself]: http://www.reddit.com

## Code and Syntax Highlighting

Code blocks are part of the Markdown spec, but syntax highlighting isn't. However, many renderers -- like Github's and Markdown Here -- support syntax highlighting. Which languages are supported and how those language names should be written will vary from renderer to renderer. Markdown Here supports highlighting for dozens of languages (and not-really-languages, like diffs and HTTP headers); to see the complete list, and how to write the language names, see the highlight.js demo page.

```
Inline `code` has `back-ticks around` it.
```

Inline `code` has `back-ticks` around it.

Blocks of code are either fenced by lines with three back-ticks ```, or are indented with four spaces. 
I recommend only using the fenced code blocks -- they're easier and only they support syntax highlighting.

```
```java
// My first component!
@Component
public class MyCmp{

	@Reference
	private MyOtherCmp cmp;
	
	@Activate
	private void activate(){
		System.out.println("Hello World!");
	}
}```
```

```java
// My first component!
@Component
public class MyCmp{

	@Reference
	private MyOtherCmp cmp;
	
	@Activate
	private void activate(){
		System.out.println("Hello World!");
	}
}
```

## Tables

Tables aren't part of the core Markdown spec, but they are part of GFM and Markdown Here supports them. They are an easy way of adding tables to your email -- a task that would otherwise require copy-pasting from another application.

```
Colons can be used to align columns.

| Tables        | Are           | Cool  |
| ------------- |:-------------:| -----:|
| col 3 is      | right-aligned | $1600 |
| col 2 is      | centered      |   $12 |
| zebra stripes | are neat      |    $1 |

There must be at least 3 dashes separating each header cell.
The outer pipes (|) are optional, and you don't need to make the 
raw Markdown line up prettily. You can also use inline Markdown.

Markdown | Less | Pretty
--- | --- | ---
*Still* | `renders` | **nicely**
1 | 2 | 3

## Blockquotes

```
> Blockquotes are very handy in email to emulate reply text.
> This line is part of the same quote.

Quote break.

> This is a very long line that will still be quoted properly when it wraps. Oh boy let's keep writing to make sure this is long enough to actually wrap for everyone. Oh, you can *put* **Markdown** into a blockquote.

## Inline HTML

You can also use raw HTML in your Markdown, and it'll mostly work pretty well.

```
<dl>
  <dt>Definition list</dt>
  <dd>Is something people use sometimes.</dd>

  <dt>Markdown in HTML</dt>
  <dd>Does *not* work **very** well. Use HTML <em>tags</em>.</dd>
</dl>
```

<dl>
  <dt>Definition list</dt>
  <dd>Is something people use sometimes.</dd>

  <dt>Markdown in HTML</dt>
  <dd>Does *not* work **very** well. Use HTML <em>tags</em>.</dd>
</dl>

## YouTube Videos

They can't be added directly but you can add an image with a link to the video like this:

```
<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&v=YOUTUBE_VIDEO_ID_HERE
" target="_blank"><img src="http://img.youtube.com/vi/YOUTUBE_VIDEO_ID_HERE/0.jpg" 
alt="IMAGE ALT TEXT HERE" width="240" height="180" border="10" /></a>
```

Or, in pure Markdown, but losing the image sizing and border:

```
[![IMAGE ALT TEXT HERE](http://img.youtube.com/vi/YOUTUBE_VIDEO_ID_HERE/0.jpg)](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YOUTUBE_VIDEO_ID_HERE)
```
