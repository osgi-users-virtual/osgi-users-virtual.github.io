question: What is the Connection Between the OSGi Alliance and the Virtual OSGi Users' Forum?
---
The Virtual OSGi Users' Forum is an open, worldwide forum for users of OSGi technology. The OSGi Alliance has granted us permission to use the OSGi trademark in certain limited ways.

The OSGi Alliance does not fund the Users' Forum. Members of the Users' Forum are not automatically members of the OSGi Alliance or *vice versa* -- though there is some natural overlap.
