question: What does OSGi Stand For?
---
Just like Harry S. Truman's middle initial, OSGi does not actually stand for anything! The full name of the technology is simply OSGi.

The [OSGi Alliance](https://www.osgi.org) was formerly known as the "Open Services Gateway initiative", but that name is obsolete.
