# Announcing the Virtual OSGi™ Users' Forum

Welcome to the Virtual OSGi™ Users' Forum!

We are a worldwide community of users of OSGi™ technology. The forum exists to promote the use of OSGi™ technology through articles, tutorials, demonstrations and other educational material. It is run by the community, for the community.

We will shortly begin moving content from various pre-existing sources onto this site. We will also publish details of how you can join the Forum and begin contributing your own content. In the meantime please consider joining the [mailing list](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/osgi-users-virtual).

```java
@Component
class Foobar implements Foo {
    @Activate
    void start() {
        System.out.println("Hello World!");
    }
}
```
